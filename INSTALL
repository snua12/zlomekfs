To get zlomekFS running, you must:

have linux system with kernel sources (or at least headers)

* get sources from http://nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~ceres/prj/zlomekFS/download/zlomekFS-SVN.tar.bz2 
  or better make export from svn (http://shiva.ms.mff.cuni.cz/svn/zzzzzfs/trunk)

* untar zlomekFS-SVN.tar.bz2 (tar -xjf zlomekFS-SVN.tar.bz2)

* make and install it (cd zlomekFS-SVN && make && make install

* make zfs chardev (mknod -m 660 /dev/zfs c 251 5)

* copy files from conf/etc/zfs to /etc/zfs

* copy directories from conf/root_node to /data

* make appropriate changes to configs (at least remove comments, examples and replace them with real data)

* if something goes wrong, try to delete comments from files, in some files they can be, elsewhere they can't be

* run zfsd

* mount zfs (mount -t zfs localhost MOUNT_DIR)

* pray to gods and keep smiling
