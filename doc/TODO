catch segfault and create core dump (RLIMIT_CORE, RLIMIT_FSIZE)

       *      The process is executing a  set-user-ID  (set-group-ID)  program
              that is owned by a user (group) other than the real user (group)
              ID of  the  process.   (However,  see  the  description  of  the
              prctl(2)  PR_SET_DUMPABLE  operation, and the description of the
              /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable file in proc(5).)

   Naming of core dump files
       By default, a core dump file is  named  core,  but  the  /proc/sys/ker-
       nel/core_pattern file (since Linux 2.6 and 2.4.21) can be set to define
       a template that is used to name core dump files.  The template can con-
       tain  % specifiers which are substituted by the following values when a
       core file is created:

         %%  A single % character
         %p  PID of dumped process
         %u  real UID of dumped process
         %g  real GID of dumped process
         %s  number of signal causing dump
         %t  time of dump (seconds since 0:00h, 1 Jan 1970)
         %h  hostname (same as ’nodename’ returned by uname(2))
         %e  executable filename
