A distributed filesystem for Linux inspired by CODA. Creates a local cache of
remote files that can be used to operate without network connection. Changes
done without network connection are integrated back to remote files when
network connection becomes available. Major difference from CODA is a
lightweight architecture that works on top of any filesystem rather
than requiring dedicated filesystem partition on the server.
