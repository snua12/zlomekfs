The initial version of zlomekFS has been written in
2004 by Josef Zlomek as his master thesis project,
with Martin Zlomek working on the kernel module
as his operating systems course project.

Support for update and reintegration over slow
connections has been added in 2005 by Vlastimil
Babka as his operating systems course project.

The project is currently maintained by Petr Tuma.
The project home page is http://nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~ceres/prj/zlomekFS.
