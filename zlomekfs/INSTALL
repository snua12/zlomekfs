To get zlomekFS running, you must:

have linux system with kernel sources (or at least headers)

* get sources from http://nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~ceres/prj/zlomekFS/download/zlomekFS-SVN.tar.bz2 
  or better make export from svn (http://shiva.ms.mff.cuni.cz/svn/zzzzzfs/trunk)

* install dependencies (syplog)

* configure & make & make install (make rpm)

* make appropriate changes to configs (at least remove comments, examples and replace them with real data)
  (config is in /etc/zfs, config volume in /var/cache/zfs)

* if something goes wrong, try to delete comments from files, in some files they can be, elsewhere they can't be

* run zfsd

* pray to gods and keep smiling
